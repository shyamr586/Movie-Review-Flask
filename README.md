# movie-review-page-with-scraping
The webpage is made using html, css and js. The scraping is done using beautiful soup 4. Remember to install bs4 and flask. A database stores all the scraped data as well as comments. Some images/video/audio maybe missing due to upload size limit.

Folder directory used for code: 

1. Python file and database to be put in a main folder with flask/bs4/sqlite3 etc. (all external libraries mentioned in python).

2. All html files to be put in a sub folder named 'templates' inside the main folder. 

3. Inside the main folder, make another sub folder called 'static'. Inside 'static', create sub folders 'audio', 'fonts', 'image', 'style' and 'video'. All mp4 files go into the 'video';  jpg/png in 'image'; mp3 files in 'audio', css file in 'style' and ttf/otf files in 'fonts'.

Run in command prompt after installing flask. Google Chrome recommended.
